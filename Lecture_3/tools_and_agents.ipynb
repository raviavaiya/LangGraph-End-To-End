      "Summary: LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\n",

      "Page: Model Context Protocol\n",
      "Summary: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by the artificial intelligence company Anthropic for enabling large language model (LLM) applications to interact with external tools, systems, and data sources. Designed to standardize context exchange between AI assistants and software environments, MCP provides a model-agnostic interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. It was officially announced and open-sourced by Anthropic in November 2024, with subsequent adoption by major AI providers including OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information. Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.\n",
      "By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. According to IBM, \"RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\"\n",
      "Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include source references in their responses, enabling users to verify information by reviewing cited documents or original sources. This can provide greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "The term \"retrieval-augmented generation\" (RAG) was first introduced in 2020 by Douwe Kiela, Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandra Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, and Sebastian Riedel in their research paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks, at Meta.\n"

The main thing this affects is the prompting strategy used. You can use an agent with a different type of model than it is intended for, but it likely won't produce results of the same quality.Supports Chat HistoryWhether or not these agent types support chat history. If it does, that means it can be used as a chatbot. If it does not, then that means it's more suited for single tasks. Supporting chat history generally requires better models, so earlier agent types aimed at worse models may not support it.Supports Multi-Input ToolsWhether or not these agent types support tools with multiple inputs. If a tool only requires a single input, it is generally easier for an LLM to know how to invoke it. Therefore, several earlier agent types aimed at worse models may not support them.Supports Parallel Function CallingHaving an LLM call multiple tools at the same time can greatly speed up agents whether there are tasks that are assisted by doing so. However, it is much more challenging for LLMs to do this, so some agent types do not support this.Required Model ParamsWhether this agent requires the model to support any additional parameters. Some agent types take advantage of things like OpenAI function calling, which require other model parameters. If none are required, then that means that everything is done via promptingWhen to UseOur commentary on when you should consider using this agent type.Agent TypeIntended Model TypeSupports Chat HistorySupports Multi-Input ToolsSupports Parallel Function CallingRequired Model ParamsWhen to UseAPITool CallingChat✅✅✅toolsIf you are using a tool-calling modelRefOpenAI ToolsChat✅✅✅tools[Legacy] If you are using a recent OpenAI model (1106 onwards).
